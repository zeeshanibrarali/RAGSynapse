    """
    Main function to run the Streamlit application for Document Insight.

    The application offers a user-friendly interface to:
    1. Upload multiple PDF documents.
    2. Process these documents by converting PDFs to text, segmenting the text, and storing them in a Chroma Vector Database.
    3. Submit queries about the processed documents and get relevant insights.

    Features:
    - Customized page title and icon.
    - Utilizes session management to retain the state of processed documents.
    - A sidebar for document uploads with relevant feedback messages.
    - A main area for processing user queries regarding the uploaded documents.

    Note:
    The actual file processing and query functionalities are encapsulated in separate functions and modules for modularity and maintainability.
